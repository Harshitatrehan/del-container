## About
The Digital Enhanced Living (DEL) container (del-container) is the container and one of the user modules for the DEL platform which handles micro health services. The service manages several micro applications and allows a user to use several health services from one single app. The container exposes several APIs that can be used to develop services for the container. Other services contributing to the platform include [__del-auth__](https://github.com/benphilip1991/del-auth), [__del-web__](https://github.com/benphilip1991/del-web) and [__del-api__](https://github.com/benphilip1991/del-api). More details can be found on their respective pages.  
_Please note that the repositories may be private at the moment and will be made public as they are developed._
